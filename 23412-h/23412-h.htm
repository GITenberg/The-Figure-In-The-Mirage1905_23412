    <p>
      On a windy night of Spring I sat by a great fire that had been built by
      Moors on a plain of Morocco under the shadow of a white city, and talked
      with a fellow-countryman, stranger to me till that day. We had met in the
      morning in a filthy alley of the town, and had forgathered. He was a
      wanderer for pleasure like myself, and, learning that he was staying in a
      dreary hostelry haunted by fever, I invited him to dine in my camp, and to
      pass the night in one of the small peaked tents that served me and my
      Moorish attendants as home. He consented gladly. Dinner was over&mdash;no
      bad one, for Moors can cook, can even make delicious caramel pudding in
      desert places&mdash;and Mohammed, my stalwart <i>valet de chambre</i>, had
      given us most excellent coffee. Now we smoked by the great fire, looked up
      at the marvellously bright stars, and told, as is the way of travellers,
      tales of our wanderings. My companion, whom I took at first to be a rather
      ironic, sceptical, and by nature &ldquo;unimaginative globe-trotter&mdash;he was
      a hard-looking, iron-grey man of middle-age&mdash;related the usual tiger
      story, the time-honoured elephant anecdote, and a couple of snake yarns of
      no special value, and I was beginning to fear that I should get little
      entertainment from so prosaic a sportsman, when I chanced to mention the
      desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said my guest, taking his pipe from his mouth, &ldquo;the desert is the
      strangest thing in nature, as woman is the strangest thing in human
      nature. And when you get them together&mdash;desert and woman&mdash;by
      Jove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, then he shot a keen glance at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever been in the Sahara?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied in the affirmative, but added that I had as yet only seen the
      fringe of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biskra, I suppose,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;and the nearest oasis, Sidi-Okba, and
      so on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. I saw I was in for another tale, and anticipated some history of
      shooting exploits under the salt mountain of El Outaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I know the Sahara pretty fairly, and about the
      oddest thing I ever could believe in I heard of and believed in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something about gazelle?&rdquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gazelle? No&mdash;a woman!&rdquo; he replied..
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a Moor glided out of the windy darkness, and threw an armful
      of dry reeds on the fire. The flames flared up vehemently, and I saw that
      the face of my companion had changed. The hardness of it was smoothed
      away. Some memory, that held its romance, sat with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; he repeated, knocking the ashes out of his pipe almost
      sentimentally&mdash;&ldquo;more than that, a French woman of Paris, with the
      nameless charm, the <i>chic</i>, the&mdash;&mdash; But I&rsquo;ll tell you. Some
      years ago three Parisians&mdash;a man, his wife, and her unmarried sister,
      a girl of eighteen, with an angel and a devil in her dark beauty&mdash;came
      to a great resolve. They decided that they were tired of the Français,
      sick of the Bois, bored to death with the boulevards, that they wanted to
      see for themselves the famous French colonies which were for ever being
      talked about in the Chamber. They determined to travel. No sooner was the
      determination come to than they were off. Hôtel des Colonies, Marseilles;
      steamboat, <i>Le Général Chanzy</i>; five o&rsquo;clock on a splendid, sunny
      afternoon&mdash;Algiers, with its terraces, its white villas, its palms,
      trees, and its Spahis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He foresaw my objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were Spahis, and that&rsquo;s a point of my story. Some fête was on in
      the town while our Parisians were there. All the African troops were out&mdash;Zouaves,
      chasseurs, tirailleurs. The Governor went in procession to perform some
      ceremony, and in front of his carriage rode sixteen Spahis&mdash;probably
      got in from that desert camp of theirs near El Outaya. All this was long
      before the Tsar visited Paris, and our Parisians had never before seen the
      dashing Spahis, had only heard of them, of their magnificent horses, their
      turbans and flowing Arab robes, their gorgeous figures, lustrous eyes, and
      diabolic horsemanship. You know how they ride? No cavalry to touch them&mdash;not
      even the Cossacks! Well, our French friends were struck. The unmarried
      sister, more especially, was <i>bouleversée</i> by these glorious demons.
      As they caracoled beneath the balcony on which she was leaning she clapped
      her little hands, in their white kid gloves, and threw down a shower of
      roses. The falling flowers frightened the horses. They pranced, bucked,
      reared. One Spahi&mdash;a great fellow, eyes like a desert eagle, grand
      aquiline profile&mdash;on whom three roses had dropped, looked up, saw
      mademoiselle&mdash;call her Valérie&mdash;gazing down with her great,
      bright eyes&mdash;they were deuced fine eyes, by Jove!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen her?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and flashed a smile at her with his white teeth. It was his last
      day in the service. He was in grand spirits. &lsquo;Mem Dieu! Mais quelles
      dents!&rsquo; she sang out. Her people laughed at her. The Spahi looked at her
      again&mdash; not smiling. She shrank back on the balcony. Then his place
      was taken by the Governor&mdash;small imperial, <i>chapeau de forme</i>,
      evening dress, landau and pair. Mademoiselle was <i>désolée</i>. Why
      couldn&rsquo;t civilised men look like Spahis? Why were all Parisians
      commonplace? Why&mdash;why? Her sister and brother-in-law called her the
      savage worshipper, and took her down to the café on the terrace to dine.
      And all through dinner mademoiselle talked of the <i>beaux</i> Spahis&mdash;in
      the plural, with a secret reservation in her heart. After Algiers our
      Parisians went by way of Constantine to Biskra. Now they saw desert for
      the first time&mdash;the curious iron-grey, velvety-brown, and rose-pink
      mountains; the nomadic Arabs camping in their earth-coloured tents patched
      with rags; the camels against the skyline; the everlasting sands, broken
      here and there by the deep green shadows of distant oases, where the
      close-growing palms, seen from far off, give to the desert almost the
      effect that clouds give to Cornish waters. At Biskra mademoiselle&mdash;oh!
      what she must have looked like under the mimosa-trees before the Hôtel de
      l&rsquo;Oasis!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve seen her,&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;mademoiselle became enthusiastic again, and, almost before they
      knew it, her sister and brother-in-law were committed to a desert
      expedition, were fitted out with a dragoman, tents, mules&mdash;the whole
      show, in fact&mdash;and one blazing hot day found themselves out in that
      sunshine&mdash;you know it&mdash;with Biskra a green shadow on that sea,
      the mountains behind the sulphur springs turning from bronze to
      black-brown in the distance, and the table flatness of the desert
      stretching ahead of them to the limits of the world and the judgment day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion paused, took a flaming reed from the fire, put it to his pipe
      bowl, pulled hard at his pipe&mdash;all the time staring straight before
      him, as if, among the glowing logs, he saw the caravan of the Parisians
      winding onward across the desert sands. Then he turned to me, sighed, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen mirage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed that in mirage the things one fancies one sees generally
      appear in large numbers&mdash;buildings crowded as in towns, trees growing
      together as in woods, men shoulder to shoulder in large companies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My experience of mirage in the desert was so, and I acknowledged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen in a mirage a solitary figure?&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought for a moment. Then I replied in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more have I,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I believe it&rsquo;s a very rare occurrence. Now
      mark the mirage that showed itself to mademoiselle on the first day of the
      desert journey of the Parisians. She saw it on the northern verge of the
      oasis of Sidi-Okba, late in the afternoon. As they journeyed Tahar, their
      dragoman&mdash;he had applied for the post, and got it by the desire of
      mademoiselle, who admired his lithe bearing and gorgeous aplomb&mdash;Tahar
      suddenly pulled up his mule, pointed with his brown hand to the horizon,
      and said in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There is mirage! Look! There is the mirage of the great desert!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Parisians, filled with excitement, gazed above the pointed ears of
      their beasts, over the shimmering waste. There, beyond the palms of the
      oasis, wrapped in a mysterious haze, lay the mirage. They looked at it in
      silence. Then Mademoiselle cried, in her little bird&rsquo;s clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mirage! But surely he&rsquo;s real?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What does mademoiselle see?&rsquo; asked Tahar quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, a sort of faint landscape, through which a man&mdash;an Arab, I
      suppose&mdash;is riding, towards Sidi&mdash;what is it?&mdash;Sidi-Okba!
      He&rsquo;s got something in front of him, hanging across his saddle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her relations looked at her in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I only see houses standing on the edge of water,&rsquo; said her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And I!&rsquo; cried the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Houses and water,&rsquo; assented Tahar. &lsquo;It is always so in the mirage of
      Sidi-Okba.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I see no houses, no water,&rsquo; cried mademoiselle, straining her eyes. &lsquo;The
      Arab rides fast, like the wind. He is in a hurry. One would think he was
      being pursued. Why, now he&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She turned to her companions. They saw still the fairy houses of the
      mirage standing in the haze on the edge of the fairy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; mademoiselle said impatiently, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing at all now&mdash;only
      sand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle dreams,&rsquo; said Tahar. &lsquo;The mirage is always there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They rode forward. That night they camped near Sidi-Okba. At dinner,
      while the stars came out, they talked of the mirage, and mademoiselle
      still insisted that it was a mirage of a horseman bearing something before
      him on his saddle-bow, and riding as if for life. And Tahar said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle dreams!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he spoke he looked at her with a mysterious intentness, which she
      noticed. That night, in her little camp-bed, round which the desert winds
      blew mildly, she did indeed dream. And her dream was of the magic forms
      that ride on magic horses through mirage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day, at dawn, the caravan of the Parisians went on its way,
      winding farther into the desert. In leaving Sidi-Okba they left behind
      them the last traces of civilisation&mdash;the French man and woman who
      keep the auberge in the orange garden there. To-day, as they journeyed, a
      sense of deep mystery flowed upon the heart of mademoiselle. She felt that
      she was a little cockle-shell of a boat which, accustomed hitherto only to
      the Seine, now set sail upon a mighty ocean. The fear of the Sahara came
      upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion paused. His face was grave, almost stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her relations?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Did they feel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t an idea what they felt,&rdquo; he answered curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you know that mademoiselle
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand at the end of the story. As they journeyed in the sun
      across the endless flats&mdash;for the mountains had vanished now, and
      nothing broke the level of the sand&mdash;mademoiselle&rsquo;s gaiety went from
      her. Silent was the lively, chattering tongue that knew the jargon of
      cities, the gossip of the Plage. She was oppressed. Tahar rode close at
      her side. He seemed to have taken her under his special protection. Far
      before them rode the attendants, chanting deep love songs in the sun. The
      sound of those songs seemed like the sound of the great desert singing of
      its wild and savage love to the heart of mademoiselle. At first her
      brother-in-law and sister bantered her on her silence, but Tahar stopped
      them, with a curious authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The desert speaks to mademoiselle,&rsquo; he said in her hearing. &lsquo;Let her
      listen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He watched her continually with his huge eyes, and she did not mind his
      glance, though she began to feel irritated and restless under the
      observation of her relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards noon Tahar again described mirage. As he pointed it out he stared
      fixedly at mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two other Parisians exclaimed that they saw forest trees, a running
      stream, a veritable oasis, where they longed to rest and eat their <i>déjeuner</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And mademoiselle?&rsquo; said Tahar. &lsquo;What does she see?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was gazing into the distance. Her face was very pale, and for a
      moment she did not answer. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I see again the Arab bearing the burden before him on the saddle. He is
      much clearer than yesterday. I can almost see his face&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She paused. She was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But I cannot see what he carries. It seems to float on the wind, like a
      robe, or a woman&rsquo;s dress. Ah! <i>mon Dieu!</i> how fast he rides!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She stared before her as if fascinated, and following with her eyes some
      rapidly-moving object. Suddenly she shut her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And now&mdash;mademoiselle sees?&rsquo; said Tahar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yet the mirage is still there,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Valérie,&rsquo; cried her sister, &lsquo;are you mad that you see what no one else
      can see, and cannot see what all else see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Am I mad, Tahar?&rsquo; she said gravely, almost timidly, to the dragoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fear of the Sahara came again upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle sees what she must,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;The desert speaks to the
      heart of mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night there was moon. Mademoiselle could not sleep. She lay in her
      narrow bed and thought of the figure in the mirage, while the moonbeams
      stole in between the tent pegs to keep her company. She thought of second
      sight, of phantoms, and of wraiths. Was this riding Arab, whom she alone
      could see, a phantom of the Sahara, mysteriously accompanying the caravan,
      and revealing himself to her through the medium of the mirage as if in a
      magic mirror? She turned restlessly upon her pillow, saw the naughty
      moonbeams, got up, and went softly to the tent door. All the desert was
      bathed in light. She gazed out as a mariner gazes out over the sea. She
      heard jackals yelping in the distance, peevish in their insomnia, and
      fancied their voices were the voices of desert demons. As she stood there
      she thought of the figure in the mirage, and wondered if mirage ever rises
      at night&mdash;if, by chance, she might see it now. And, while she stood
      wondering, far away across the sand there floated up a silvery haze, like
      a veil of spangled tissue&mdash;exquisite for a ball robe, she said long
      after!&mdash;and in this haze she saw again the phantom Arab galloping
      upon his horse. But now he was clear in the moon. Furiously he rode, like
      a thing demented in a dream, and as he rode he looked back over his
      shoulder, as if he feared pursuit. Mademoiselle could see his fierce eyes,
      like the eyes of a desert eagle that stares unwinking at the glaring
      African sun. He urged on his fleet horse. She could hear now the ceaseless
      thud of its hoofs upon the hard sand as it drew nearer and nearer. She
      could see the white foam upon its steaming flanks, and now at last she
      knew that the burden which the Arab bore across his saddle and supported
      with his arms was a woman. Her robe flew out upon the wind; her dark,
      loose hair streamed over the breast of the horseman; her face was hidden
      against his heart; but mademoiselle saw his face, uttered a cry, and
      shrank back against the canvas of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For it was the face of the Spahi who had ridden in the procession of the
      Governor&mdash;of the Spahi to whom she had thrown the roses from the
      balcony of Algiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As she cried out the mirage faded, the Arab vanished, the thud of the
      horse&rsquo;s hoofs died in her ears, and Tahar, the dragoman, glided round the
      tent, and stood before her. His eyes gleamed in the moonlight like ebon
      jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; he whispered, &lsquo;mademoiselle sees the mirage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle could not speak. She stared into the eyes of Tahar, and hers
      were dilated with wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He drew nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle has seen again the horseman and his burden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She bowed her head. All things seemed dream-like to her. Tahar&rsquo;s voice
      was low and monotonous, and sounded far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is fate,&rsquo; he said. He paused, gazing upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the tents they all sleep,&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;Even the watchman sleeps,
      for I have given him a powder of hashish, and hashish gives long dreams&mdash;long
      dreams.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From beneath his robe he drew a small box, opened it, and showed to
      mademoiselle a dark brown powder, which he shook into a tiny cup of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle shall drink, as the watchman has drunk,&rsquo; he said&mdash;&lsquo;shall
      drink and dream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He held the cup to her lips, and she, fascinated by his eyes, as by the
      eyes of a mesmerist, could not disobey him. She swallowed the hashish,
      swayed, and fell forward into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment later, across the spaces of the desert, whitened by the moon,
      rode the figure mademoiselle had seen in the mirage. Upon his saddle he
      bore a dreaming woman. And in the ears of the woman through all the night
      beat the thunderous music of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs spurning the desert sand.
      Mademoiselle had taken her place in the vision which she no longer saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion paused. His pipe had gone out. He did not relight it, but sat
      looking at me in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Spahi?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had claimed the giver of the roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Tahar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shots he fired after the Spahi missed fire. Yet Tahar was a notable
      shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strange tale,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How did you come to hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year ago I penetrated very far into the Sahara on a sporting
      expedition. One day I came upon an encampment of nomads. The story was
      told me by one of them as we sat in the low doorway of an earth-coloured
      tent and watched the sun go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you by an Arab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a woman with a clear little bird&rsquo;s voice, with an angel and a devil in
      her dark beauty, a woman with the gesture of Paris&mdash;the grace, the <i>diablerie</i>
      of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Light broke on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By mademoiselle!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;by madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the figure in the mirage; and she was content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content with her two little dark children dancing before her in the
      twilight, content when the figure of the mirage galloped at evening across
      the plain, shouting an Eastern love song, with a gazelle&mdash;instead of
      a woman&mdash;slung across his saddle-bow. Did I not say that, as the
      desert is the strangest thing in nature, so a woman is the strangest thing
      in human nature? Which heart is most mysterious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its heart?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the heart of mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give the palm to the latter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; he answered, taking off his wide-brimmed hat&mdash;&ldquo;I gave it
      when I saluted her as madame before the tent door, out there in the great
      desert.&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
